            <h1 class='uppercase'>Rules to survive</h1>
            <p>Most of these rules actually come directly from the movie Zombieland, but are great tips in not just surviving our server, but any Miscreated server.</p>
            <div class='article'>
                <h2>1. Cardio</h2>
                <p>Pretty much all of the zombies have a set radius that they stay in. As long as you keep running, you should be able to make it out alive.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
                <h2>2. Double tap</h2>
                <p>Make sure they are dead! Granted, our zombies don't get back up if they fall, so just make sure you get those headshots.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
                <h2>3. Check bathroom</h2>
                <p>This one more or less doesn't apply, but we will take this time to address your needs as well. Make sure you are prepared to play when you hop on. Food, drink, bathroom, etc. Don't turn your back on the game unless you are in a base, and even then you shouldn't for very long times!</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>4. Seatbelt</h2>
                <p>Seatbelts don't exist in the game, however, careful driving is just as important. Be aware of your vehicles condition, and needs. Oil, Fuel and health can degrade quickly if you aren't on top of it.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>5. Travel light</h2>
                <p>Theres nothing worse than needing another wheel for your car, and having to drop a ton of gear to pick one up on the road. Travelling light makes things easier.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>6. Limber Up</h2>
                <p>This doesn't so much apply in terms of the game, however, keep your characters health up to par. Take antibiotics for infections, try to reduce radiation sickness, etc. All of these things do play a part in the overall stamina and could mean the difference between life and death.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>7. Don't be a hero</h2>
                <p>This is up to your discretion. Personally it has bit me more than once. If someone is being swarmed, do not go in after them!</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>8. When in doubt, know your way out</h2>
                <p>All it takes is your friend with the .357 to shoot a zombie to attract a nearby horde, and flood the gas station you're looting, and turn you into a chew toy. Know your exits when you enter places!</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>9. Buddy system</h2>
                <p>This goes specifically for our server. We highly advise you employ the buddy system. This will give you a higher chance of survival as well as second set of eyes.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
            <h2>10. Check the back seat</h2>
                <p>Good items found in cars can be easily overlooked. I have almost missed a Mk18 rifle, and would of continued had I not seen the shell in the magazine on top of it. Check the back seat!</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class='article'>
                <h2>11. Enjoy the little things</h2>
                <p>This is a zombie survival game. You will die! Its part of the challenge! Try to not let it ruin the experience, and instead learn from what caused your death.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>Follow these rules and you are likely to prosper in Miscreated and our Miscreated server! Good luck!</p>
